bus walker is an application made to use a gps system that checks for nearby bus stops and notifies the user if a bus that can help lead the user to their destination (Either halfway all all the way)
if its below their chosen time (If user can only wait for a bus for 10 mins and below, etc)

this allows the user to decide if they should just wait for the bus or continue walking to their destination
this app is for the busybody who can not wait for a bus or call/check the eta of a bus
